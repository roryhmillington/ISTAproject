###Overview

The program will contain a single GUI that acts as the user interface. This interface will contain one view
The user interface will have three primary sections.The login panel, main panel, and three measurement and calculation panels.

The login panel, will have sign in and login icons. The main panel will contain personal information and point to the section the user wants to access, to check, or to modify. The values will be stored or deleted determined by the user every time he updates the application. Icons will be interactive.  

The body fat panel will be primarily calculation blocks.The muscle measurement panel well primarily just be a storage for measurements taken by the user. The personal record panel will both calculate and store data that they can track their values. 

###Functional Requirements
The items in the program will be represented by values to be added, modified, and deleted if necessary.
Sections are broken down into personal , measurement, calculation, and performance data - body fat data, muscle measurements,  and performance data.The personal information inputs, that are held in the database point to their values that are reflected in the program. The entries by the user, well be stored and modified as needed.
The program must be able to interface with the database to provide the user a view and access to change all their personal data, and be able to retrieve previous data upon request. The user is the component of the GUI that is interactive.
