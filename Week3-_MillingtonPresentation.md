**BRO'S KNOW (Leroy Jenkins Edition)**

**Introduction Background**

Hello there my fellow blast enthusiasts

My name is Rory Millington, I am a transitions Army Warrant Officer, Army Aviator, with over 23 years of service. My life long passion has always been with bodybuilding. When I was ten I had my first weight set, yes the old plastic sand weights and a bench. Along with a book called "Getting Stronger" written by Bill Pearl. I was hooked right from the beginning. The gym has always been a place for balance for me. Mind, body, and spirit concept. A place where I can take out my aggression, relieve some daily stress, and have a great confidence in looking and feeling good. Over years in and out of so many gyms all over the country and the world for that matter, there is always the common talk around the gym we will call "Bro Talk" usually about personal goals, opinionated gossip on the heard this and that we will call "Bro Science". Now as a current Student in The MSSA (Microsoft Software Systems Academy). I am choosing as my class project to come up with an application that can be a quick reference for Bro's in the gym, during these Bro Talk sessions and to also give the user a great overall body composition picture not only to track your progress, see some results to your hard work, see where you could make some improvements, but to also be able to brag a little to your Bro's.  

In gyms across the world you will hear the word **"BRO'S"** as you can easily ascertain by this context that this is short for Brother. This term has had many negative connotations over the years, that is not the case here. BRO's in this context represents the Brothers who Body Build , Body Sculpt, Body Shape, as a art form, a discipline, a way of life. Those dedicated to the hard work training spending hours in the gym, hours on their diet, day in and day out to produce the best physic they can. Its a bond among those who KNOW, because only a **BRO's KNOW** the hard work and dedicated that goes into this lifestyle. This application will allow fellow BRO's can have a quick reference to commonly asked questions during BRO Talk. Like "BRO your looking shredded, What's your body fat percentage?" or "BRO your arms are huge, what are they measuring?" and the every so common "BRO, what are you benching these days?" all this and more you can answer soon enough.  This application will be known as the **BRO's KNOW** **(Leroy Jenkins Edition). **


**HUMBLE SALAD**

This section will calculate body fat percentages using the Jackson-Pollock 7 site method. 
This area will allow the user to input each measurement into for each site measured. 
There are 7 area’s that will be measured, and this is done two times, in the same locations each time, 
if there is a difference exceeding more than two millimeters, then a third is required.

**SWOLEMETER**

The second section will contain text blocks that tracks measurements of the major muscle groups i.e. arms, chest, back, thighs along with weight, to give the user and idea of muscle gains made based on weight and the body fat calculation from the first section.

**REALITYCHECK** 
The last section will track your PR’s (Personal Record) of amount of weight lifted for their personal best in multiple types of lifts. Once PR’s are established you can adjust percentages to use throughout your sets. So, if you are doing five sets, and want to do the first set at 70% of your max weight,this allows for a quick computation.  As this application evolves, more sections may be added, deleted, or modified to give the user a one stop shot at his or her overall progress. 

**Conclusion**

As I hope I've demonstrated that this app with be a great edition to your routine and BroLifeOrNoLife Lifestyle. Happy Blasting.
