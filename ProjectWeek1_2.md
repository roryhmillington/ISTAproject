**BRO'S KNOW (Leroy Jenkins Edition)**

In gyms across the world you will hear the word **"BRO'S"** as you can easily ascertain by this context that this is short for Brother. This term has had many negative connotations over the years, that is not the case here. BRO's in this context represents the Brothers who Body Build , Body Sculpt, Body Shape, as a art form, a discipline, a way of life. Those dedicated to the hard work training spending hours in the gym, hours on their diet, day in and day out to produce the best physic they can. Its a bond among those who KNOW, because only a **BRO's KNOW** the hard work and dedicated that goes into this lifestyle. This application will allow fellow BRO's can have a quick reference to commonly asked questions during BRO Talk. Like "BRO your looking shredded, What's your body fat percentage?" or "BRO your arms are huge, what are they measuring?" and the every so common "BRO, what are you benching these days?"

**APPLICATION**

Create a graphical application that computes multiple inputs types of Bodybuilding data to track progress in multiple areas. This application will be known as the **BRO's KNOW** **(Leroy Jenkins Edition). **


**HUMBLE SALAD**

This section will calculate body fat percentages using the Jackson-Pollock 7 site method. 
This area will allow the user to input each measurement into for each site measured. 
There are 7 area’s that will be measured, and this is done two times, in the same locations each time, 
if there is a difference exceeding more than two millimeters, then a third is required.

**SWOLEMETER**

The second section will contain text blocks that tracks measurements of the major muscle groups i.e. arms, chest, back, thighs along with weight, to give the user and idea of muscle gains made based on weight and the body fat calculation from the first section.

**REALITYCHECK** 
The last section will track your PR’s (Personal Record) of amount of weight lifted for their personal best in multiple types of lifts. Once PR’s are established you can adjust percentages to use throughout your sets. So, if you are doing five sets, and want to do the first set at 70% of your max weight,this allows for a quick computation.  As this application evolves, more sections may be added, deleted, or modified to give the user a one stop shot at his or her overall progress.
